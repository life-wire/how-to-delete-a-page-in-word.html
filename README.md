If you’re wanting to delete a page containing text, graphics, or other content in a Microsoft Word document, or if you’re wanting to get rid of that blank white page at the end of your report that won’t appear to go away, here’s how.


## Deleting a Page in Word


* The first thing you’ll want to do is tap anywhere on the page that you want to delete. You can see the page number of the page you’re on by looking in the bottom-left corner of the window.

* Next, press Ctrl + G on Windows, or Option + Command + G on Mac. You’ll now be in the “Go To” tab of the “Find & Replace” window. Now, type \page in the “Enter Page Number” text box. Select “Go To.”

* All of the content on your current page will be selected. All that’s left to do now is press the Backspace key (or Delete on Mac).


## Delete the Blank Page at the End of Word


* If you’ve ever wondered why there’s a blank page at the end of your Word document that won’t go away, that’s because the word processor includes an end paragraph that can’t be deleted. This sometimes causes a blank page to appear at the end of a document, depending on where the last line of your content ended.

* Because this ending paragraph can’t be deleted, the only way to really remove the blank page at the end is to give it a 1pt font size.

* The first thing you’ll want to do is show the paragraph marks on your Word doc. To do this, press Ctrl + Shift+8 (Command + 8 on Mac).

* Now, select the paragraph mark. You can’t do this by clicking and dragging your cursor over it. To select it, put your cursor on the icon and give it a double click.
